# decision-tree

some practice for decision tree

- the tree.py can be used in other applications.
- train.txt include the training data.
- training file:
    - the first line should be the list of attributes that do not include the target attribute.
    - the second line should be the target attribute.
    - from third line, there is no empty line in this file.
    - put the training data in order above.
- cross_chain file:
    - the first line is the list of attributes that do not include the target attribute.
    - the string in the "()" is the real correct class name.
- the theory of this code is from the chapter 3 of Machine learning written by Tom M.Mitchell.
